These are the hospitals with the highest mean procedure scores.
(hospital name, mean score, sd of scores, and number of scores)

Note that any hospital with fewer than 16 procedure scores has been
omitted from this list.  Emergency Department (including OP_18b is
omitted from this list, as it uses a different scale, and ER metrics
such as wait time were not judged to be critical to general care.)
More details in the report.md file in the repo.

Note that many of these top hospitals are scored so close together
that there may not be a practical distinction between them.
