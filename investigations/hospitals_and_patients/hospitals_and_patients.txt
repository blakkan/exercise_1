Here are the correlations of Hospital Average Scores with survey responses
and SD of scores with survey responses.

Note that survey responses are calculated from the HCAPS data base score
(a 0-80 score) plus the consistency score (a 0-20 score) giving a total
maximum survey score (this is per the description of the data on the
medicare site.)

Correlation coefficeint of average score to survey total score:
-0.06569066638536455

This is so small as to have no practical significance.

Correlation coefficient of sd of scores to survey total score:
0.12463353598719493

This is also a small effect, and in an unexpected direction- high
variation leads to higher satisfaction.   Further investigation is needed,
perhaps the high-variation is because the most important results (with
respect to patient satisfaction) are extremely high in good hospitals.

But the general conclusion is that there is little practical correlation
between test metrics and test variation metrics and survey responses.
